  \noindent
  Standards and standard setting are of great importance to government
  and the private sector. It is also a complex field that has
  developed it's own terminology and lingo. There is also not a lot of
  consistency in how terms are used. Even fundamental terms like
  \gls{std} are difficult to define. Let's make a common glossary for
  them.
